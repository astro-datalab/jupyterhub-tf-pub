              Welcome to the NOIRLab Data Lab Notebook Server

   The JupyterHub server provides a shell access to authenticated users
to enable bulk transfer of files/data for use in notebooks, or to update
example notebooks to the latest version using shell commands. It contains
at least the following three directories:

    notebooks/          User notebook directory
    notebooks-latest/   Latest Data Lab notebooks (read-only access)
    vospace/            A link to the user's VOSpace directory (experimental)

Please consult notebooks-latest/_README.txt for brief information about the
default notebooks provided with your account.  To get the latest copies of
the default notebooks copied to your 'notebooks' directory, type

        % getlatest     # this is defined in your .bashrc file

Existing dir will be backed-up to 'notebooks_<timestamp>'.

The shell provides the following commands which may be used to import
external data or files:

    scp                 Secure copy from remote host 
    ssh                 Remote login program
    rsync               Sync directories to/from remote host
    sftp                Secure file transfer to/from remote host
    git                 Git client
    curl/wget           Network download clients

You may pull-from or push-to a remote machine using these commands, but
due to firewall  restrictions it is not possible to  upload or download
directly to/from this machine.
